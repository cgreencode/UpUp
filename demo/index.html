  <title>UpUp - Make sure your site never is always there for your users.</title>

<body>
  <h1>A tiny script that makes sure your site is always there for your users</h1>
  <h2>(even when they're on a plane over the Atlantic, or 20,000 leagues under the sea)</h2>
  <p>Imagine opening TripAdvisor on your laptop and getting the top 5 attractions in Rome, half an hour after take-off from JFK.</p>
  <p>Imagine opening Booking.com on your tablet and seeing the address for your hotel reservation, while on the cab from the airport.</p>
  <p>Imagine checking your corporate site from your phone in that one spot in your house where the wi-fi is never good enough (you know the place) and getting a list of your upcoming meetings for the day.</p>

  <p>The days when you could count on your visitors sitting at their desktops, with a wire connecting them to the internet are long gone. Today, your users are visiting your site from a phone in the elevator, from their tablet on the subway, or on their laptop while they sit cramped into seat 25 E.</p>
  <p>Luckily, modern browsers support technologies that let you serve your content to your users, even when they are offline.</p>
  <p>UpUp makes all of this modern magic as simple as calling one command.</p>
  <pre><code class="javascript">
&lt;script src="upup.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script&gt;
  UpUp.start({
    'content-url': 'offline.html' // show this to page to offline users
  });
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>
  <p>It's time to start the <strong>offline-first</strong> revolution.</p>

<script src="upup.min.js"></script>
<script>
  // Let's turn on debugging messages
  UpUp.debug();

  // Let's start UpUp with some basic settings
  UpUp.start({
    'content-url': 'offline.html',
    'assets': ['img/porthole.png', 'css/offline.css', 'css/bootstrap.min.css', 'js/offline.js', 'nyt-bestsellers.json']
  });
